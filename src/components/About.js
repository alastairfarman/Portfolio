          I have 10 years experience working in the e-commerce and fashion
          industries, starting off as a CMS admin for a small independent
          retailer, quickly moving into photography and retouch.
          <br />
          <br />
          In addition to recently going freelance, I have worked in various
          in-house photography studio roles, as a senior retoucher and
          photographer primarily leading workflow processes, QC, and ecommerce
          product image art direction.

          Since June 2022 I have thrown myself into becoming a self-taught
          frontend web developer, mainly via The Odin Project curriculum and
          other helpful resources.
          <br />
          <br />
          I have also learned the fundamentals of 3D software, playing with
          Blender both for fun and to test ideas for profesional work as the
          industry progresses.
